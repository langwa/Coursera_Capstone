As such, independent restaurant ownership has a higher barrier to entry than ever before. A path forward for the independent restauranteur lies in the food cart scene, which has a large footprint in Portland, OR. Outside of reduced overall foot traffic, managing a food cart does not share many of the financial burdens of opening a restaurant that are so critically hampered by the uncertainties in revenue from reductions in customers and employees.\n</p>\n<p>\nGiven the large footprint in Portland, OR, competition can be fierce. The question becomes: where should you open a food cart to optimize customer engagement while minimizing competition?\n</p>"
